// distance bookkeeping + identity-anchor override). See README for receipts.
//
// The combo under test:
//   1. aggregate top/bottom spacers — rendered rows stay in normal document
//      flow between two placeholder divs (Rocksteady-style occupancy, O(1)
//      placeholder nodes);
//   2. bottom-distance bookkeeping as the default reference frame — the
//      desired position is stored as "px from the bottom edge"; above-viewport
//      estimate→measured swaps and pinned tail growth are both identity
//      operations in this frame (ChatGPT-style coordinates);
//   3. identity-anchor override while scrolled up — reading history anchors
//      the first row intersecting the viewport top, so above-window size
//      corrections keep the row you're reading visually frozen.
//
// Corrections are SYNCHRONOUS pre-paint: every commit's layout effect runs
// the pass — measure ('sync' re-reads the whole window's offsetHeight;
// 'ro', the default, forced-reads only never-seen rows and takes the rest
// from ResizeObserver callbacks), recompute offsets, resize the spacers,
// restore scrollTop from the mode — all before the browser paints. No
// compensation deltas anywhere: position is always re-derived from the
// stored reference, so a single miss self-heals.
